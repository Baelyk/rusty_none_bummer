# None Bummer

A web "application" I made so that my friends and I can keep track of fun things
we do over the summer. I didn't have a say for most of the activities so don't judge me.

It is powered by [Rocket](https://rocket.rs) and [Diesel](http://diesel.rs). I
use a Postgres database (probably overkill to be honest) to maintain a list of
activities and friends.
